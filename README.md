Project Title: Predicting House Prices Using Regression Models
📌 Project Description:
This project focuses on analyzing a real estate dataset to understand how various housing features influence property prices. Using Python and data science libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib, we explore the relationships between features and price, visualize patterns, and build predictive models.

🔍 Objectives:
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.

Visualize data using boxplots, regression plots, and heatmaps to uncover patterns and outliers.

Handle missing values and drop unnecessary columns.

Use linear regression and Ridge regression models to predict house prices.

Evaluate models using R² score.

Apply polynomial transformations to capture non-linear relationships.

Use pipelines and GridSearchCV to streamline model building and hyperparameter tuning.

🧠 Key Features Used:
sqft_living: Total square footage of the house

sqft_above: Square footage above ground

bedrooms, bathrooms: Number of bedrooms and bathrooms

waterfront: Whether the house has a waterfront view

smoker: (from earlier questions – if applicable)

floors: Number of floors

🛠️ Methods and Tools:
Pandas for data manipulation

Seaborn & Matplotlib for data visualization

Scikit-learn for:

Model training (LinearRegression, Ridge)

Evaluation (r2_score)

Data splitting and preprocessing (train_test_split, PolynomialFeatures, Pipeline)

Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)

📈 Outcomes:
Identified key variables that influence house prices.

Found that sqft_living and waterfront have strong correlations with price.

Used Ridge regression and polynomial features to improve model performance.

Demonstrated the effectiveness of cross-validation and regularization in preventing overfitting.

🧾 Conclusion:
This project highlights the power of regression techniques in real estate price prediction. Through thoughtful data preparation, visualization, and modeling, we built interpretable and effective models for estimating property values. This approach could be extended or deployed in real-world property valuation tools.
